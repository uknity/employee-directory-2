Deployed Site URL: https://uknity.github.io/employee-directory-2/  
## Description

This employee director, powered by React, enables users to generate a list of employees containing basic contact information and an image of the employee.  As users type an employee name in the search bar, the employee table begins to shrink to show only employees whose names match the search criteria.

## Installation

No specific installation steps are needed.  If a user wants to display their own employees, they will need to tie the site in with a personal database like MySQL or MongoDB, or they may create an array of employee objects with employee information.

## Usage

To use this site, please visit the deployed URL and begin typing the name of an employee.  Search results will display.

## Credits

This project was completed with the assistance of the faculty of the Georgia Tech Bootcamp.

## Test

To test, simply visit the deployed site and search employees by name.
